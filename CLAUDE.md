# Nano Backend.AI — Agent Guidelines (Root)

See `README.md` for project overview, architecture, and tech stack.

## Documentation Hierarchy

- **Root CLAUDE.md** (this file): global principles applicable everywhere
- **Sub-directory CLAUDE.md**: local rules scoped to that directory only
- **`docs/design/`**: detailed design documents and rationale

## CLAUDE.md Authoring Rules

- Policy and role only — no verbose implementation details
- Root document = global principles; sub-documents = local rules
- Keep each file short so agent context is not overwhelmed

## Language & Conventions

- Go (latest stable)
- Format: `gofmt` — all code must pass before commit
- Lint: `golangci-lint run ./...` — treat all warnings as errors
- Write English comments; Korean is acceptable in design docs under `docs/`

## Branch Naming

`<type>/<short-description>` — examples:

- `feat/health-api`, `fix/session-timeout`, `refactor/error-handling`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`

## API Response Conventions

All external API responses use structured JSON:

```json
{ "status": "...", "reason": "...", "next_action_hint": "..." }
```

No unstructured text in API responses. Long-running operations return a pollable job ID.

## Dependency Rules

- No circular dependencies between packages
- Minimal exported API — expose only what is needed
- Internal package communication via defined interfaces, not reaching into internals

## Test Principles

- Unit tests: `_test.go` files alongside source
- Integration tests: top-level `tests/` directory or build-tagged files
- Every public function must have both **success** and **error/edge** test scenarios
- All tests must pass before PR submission — no exceptions

## Prohibitions

- No `panic()` in library code — return `error` values
- No `os.Exit()` outside `main()`
- No `fmt.Println` for logging — use `log/slog`
- No `unsafe` without a comment justifying why it is necessary

## Work Decomposition

Decompose work into Epic → Story → Task.

| Unit | Definition | Size guide |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Epic** | A single business goal. Composed of multiple Stories/PRs | Tracked via GitHub Milestone |
| **Story** | 1 PR = one clear deliverable. The core unit for achieving an Epic | One learning session's worth; small enough for an AI agent to design and execute without gaps |
| **Task** | A one-off chore smaller than a Story. Not core to the Epic but needed for progress (env setup, label creation, CI fixes, etc.) | Single commit or no commit needed |

### Principles

- **Single goal**: If you need "and" to describe it, split it
- **Vertical slice**: Each Story includes type definition → implementation → tests (never slice horizontally)
- **Independently executable**: Each Story can be developed and tested alone, given prior Stories are merged
- **Acceptance Criteria required**: No AC means it is not a Story
- **Parallelism first**: Minimize inter-Story dependencies so they can proceed concurrently

### Design Principles for Parallelism

Code design must support parallel Story execution:

- **Trait/interface first**: Finalize abstractions in a preceding Story so implementation Stories can proceed in parallel
- **Enforce behavior via structure**: Use compile-time contracts to prevent integration mismatches
- **Localize modifications**: Design boundaries so changes are contained within a single module
- **Explicit dependency graph**: When creating an Epic, annotate blocks/blockedBy between Stories to visualize parallelizable segments

### Size Threshold

Split a Story further if any of the following apply:

- Expected to change more than 5 files
- Introduces 2 or more new concepts simultaneously
- Has more than 3 ACs
